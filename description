Army Battle Simulation
Description

    This project is a simulator for battles between two armies, allowing users to create their own armies by selecting different 
    military units and their quantities. Each unit is assigned strength points that influence their chances of winning in battle.

    I wanted to create a project that differs from most games by not simply showing that a unit with higher strength and health always wins. 
    Instead, I aimed to demonstrate that even a weaker unit always has a chance to emerge victorious. This project serves to illustrate 
    how this technology works, and I plan to continue developing it further, integrating it into the game I am creating.

Features

    Army Creation: Users can build two armies by selecting various types of units and their quantities.
    Battle Simulation: After building the armies, the program calculates the winning chances for each army and randomly selects a winner based on those probabilities.
    Interactivity: Users have the option to continue the game and organize additional battles.

Technologies

    C++ (C++ compiler)
    Standard C++ Libraries: iostream, string, vector, ctime, thread

Example

Upon starting the program, users will be prompted to enter the number of unit types for both armies, as well as their selections and quantities. 
The program will calculate the winning chances and display the battle results.
